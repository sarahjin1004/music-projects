## Repository for music projects
### Some ideas:
- Spotify Web API has music recommendation API that allows users to retrieve music recommendation based on selected features. Using the UI to select each feature, users can visually select each feature that they would like.
- Analyze user's playlist and extract the most common feature. They like the song but they don't know why. Users are curious about what features that they like. This project will let them know, by data, what kind of music they enjoy listening to.
